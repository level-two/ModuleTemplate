# Data layer

In Clean Architecture, the Data Layer is responsible for managing data operations and is typically structured to separate concerns and ensure the flexibility and maintainability of the application. Here's how you might structure the Data Layer:

### Typical Structure of the Data Layer

1. **Repositories**
   - **Purpose**: Act as an intermediary between the data sources and the domain layer, abstracting the data operations.
   - **Naming Convention**: Use the suffix `Imp` for implementations, e.g., `ProductRepositoryImp`.
   - **Responsibilities**: 
     - Provide operations for data manipulation such as fetch, save, update, or delete.
     - Convert data from data source models to domain models.

2. **Data Sources**
   - **Purpose**: Serve as the actual source of data, which could be local (e.g., databases) or remote (e.g., network services).
   - **Types**:
     - **Local Data Source**: Manages data storage and retrieval from the local database or cache.
     - **Remote Data Source**: Handles communication with remote services or APIs.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Define interfaces for data operations specific to the type of data source.
     - Implement data fetching, storing, and updating logic specific to the data source.

3. **External Module Reference**
   - **Purpose**: Facilitate integration with external services or modules, such as a CMS.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use dependency injection to provide instances of external services.
     - Define interfaces to abstract communication details.
     - Implement adapters or clients that handle the specifics of communicating with the external module.

### Example Structure for E-commerce App's Products Module

- **Repositories**
  - `ProductRepositoryImp`: Implements product-related data operations.

- **Data Sources**
  - `ProductLocalDataSource`: Manages local database operations for products.
  - `ProductRemoteDataSource`: Handles API calls to fetch products from the CMS.

- **External Module Integration**
  - `CmsModule`: A client or service class that communicates with the CMS module.
  - Dependency Injection: Inject `CmsModule` into `ProductRemoteDataSource` to fetch data.

This structure ensures that the Data Layer is well-organized and follows the principles of Clean Architecture, facilitating easier maintenance and adaptability to changes.
